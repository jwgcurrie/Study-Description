# Study-Description
You will be tested either alongside another participant or a robot. You will be sat at a table with another person or robot sat adjacent to you. Numbers and letters will be projected onto the table. You be asked to decide, as quickly and accurately as possible, whether they are mirror-inverted or in their normal form, by pressing a button. The experiment will consist of 8 blocks and will last roughly 45 minutes. Between each block, participants can take a break of a length of their choosing.
